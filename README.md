# Quotes DB


This webapp is supposed to be a quote DB which I plan to publish so my friends can use it in real life.

We went through many interesting chats and found it hard to document if someone said something that's really cool.

So this simple webapp is where users can upload what quote they would like to store, it can be in form of text or a screenshot.


# Getting started with Django

In this project, I am self learning django and getting a better understanding of how the web works.

Trying to figure out how databases, userforms and URLs work together.

I am really excited about this and I hope it all goes fine.

Wish me luck  :smiley: 


# List of stuff to implement

So here is a list of some stuff I'd like to add before publishing

1. - [x] Redirect user to quotes page after posting quote
2. Add author to models where author is always user unless otherwise specified
3. - [x] Set quote title in a way to avoid duplicates
4. - [x] Give it a bit more styling
5. Add votes , up and down
6. Publish
