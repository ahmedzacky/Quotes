# Getting started with Django


This webapp is supposed to be a quote DB which I plan to publish to my friends to use it in real life.
We've went through many talks together and found it hard to document what would happen when someone says something really awesome.
So i got the idea to build this quite simple webapp and integrate as much features as I can while leaving it minimalistic.
In my webapp you can upload what quote would you like to store it can be in form of text or a screenshot.

In this project, I am self learning django and getting a better understanding of how the web works.

So I've choosen django to build rather a fully featured dynamic webapp with database and userforms and try figure out how everything works together.

I am really excited about this and I hope it all goes fine.

Wish me luck :)
